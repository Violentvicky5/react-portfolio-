            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I'm someone who believes that continuous learning and curiosity are the driving forces behind meaningful growth. My approach to development blends both creativity and logic — I enjoy solving problems while also focusing on creating smooth, user-friendly experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                What sets me apart is my strong ability to adapt and self-learn. Coming from a non-traditional tech background, I've trained myself through practical projects, online courses, and consistent hands-on practice. I'm not just building projects — I'm building confidence, skill, and a future.

            <p>
                Outside of coding, I find inspiration in music, movies, and long-distance travel — experiences that fuel my creativity and help me see tech as a tool for real-world impact. I'm excited by challenges, whether it’s debugging a tricky function or designing a responsive UI from scratch
            </p>
            <p>
               As I continue my journey toward becoming a full stack developer, my focus is on collaborating with like-minded teams, contributing to real-world projects, and always keeping the user at the center of everything I build
