        <p style={{color:"whitesmoke", fontFamily:"cursive"}}>I’m Vignesh Ravichandran, a 28-year-old aspiring full stack developer, driven by curiosity and a deep interest in technology. I completed my B.E. degree (2015–2019 batch) after overcoming personal and financial hurdles that temporarily interrupted my academic journey. Despite the challenges, I’ve cleared all my remaining subjects and am now awaiting final results, expecting around 80% CGPA.
I started my self-learning journey in December 2024, beginning with front-end development. Over time, I developed a strong interest in full stack development. I’ve completed a Full Stack Development course on Udemy, and have consistently practiced using platforms like YouTube, personal projects, and coding exercises.
I also bring one year of real-world work experience as a Sales Executive at Buzzworks Pvt Ltd, a hiring partner for Muthoot Finance. It helped me build communication, patience, and decision-making skills, while I continued learning tech in parallel.
I believe in being a continuous learner. Whether it’s through online platforms, working on projects, or just diving into documentation — I truly enjoy how this field keeps me thinking and engaged.
